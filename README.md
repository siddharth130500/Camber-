# Camber Change with wheel travel

# Camber Angle - 
Camber angle is the angle made by the wheels of a vehicle; specifically, it is the angle between the vertical axis of the wheels used for steering and the vertical axis of the vehicle when viewed from the front or rear.

This code outputs the change in Camber Angle value with respect to the wheel travel for a double wishbone suspension system with the parameters being the chassis points (the points where the suspension is attached to the chassis of the vehicle) and the coordinates of of the lower and upper ball joints when viwed from the front view.
